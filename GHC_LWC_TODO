* Unblock actions must be evaluated before block actions -- HIGH
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is necessary since the completion of block action might depend on the
completion of unblock action.

* Implementing sleep/wakeup capabilities -- HIGH

* Block action blocking on a blackhole -- MED
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Must implement block action blocking on a blackhole. For blocking on a different
capability, we must create block and unblock actions using sleepCapability and
wakeupCapability. For blocking on current capability, we need to build AP_STACK.

* Vanilla GHC threads blocking on blackholes -- MED
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vanilla GHC threads (created through GHC.Conc.forkIO) can also block on
blackholes. Since these vanilla GHC threads do not have scheduler actions, how
do we block them on black holes?

We may choose to have the following in MessageBlackHole structure instead of
either one:

union {
  StgTSO* tso;
  StgClosure* closure;
}

and distinguish them using a flag.

* Upcall threads blocking on RTS MVars -- LOW
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the behavior of upcall threads blocking on RTS MVars? Should it also
have:

union {
  StgTSO* tso;
  StgClosure* closure;
}


* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Work initiation on other capabilities -- LOW
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, the substrate primitive scheduleSContOnFreeCap :: SCont -> IO () is
used to initiate task execution on other capabilities. But this method is not
robust. If there are no free capabilities, the call does not return!! Need to
implement something like

thread_main :: IO ()

in the same vein as

main :: IO (). thread_main is the entry point for capabilities with cap->no >=
1. But how do we share work between cap 0 and cap 1+? May be we need to change
main and thread_main to have a type

main :: PVar -> IO ()
thread_main :: PVar -> IO ()

with the main and thread_main applied to the same PVar. This PVar can be used as
the conduit for sharing work between the capabilities.
